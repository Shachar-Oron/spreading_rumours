# Spreading Rumours
## Project Overview
This project focuses on simulating the spread of rumors within a population, represented on a 100x100 grid. The individuals in the population have varying levels of skepticism (S4, S3, S2, and S1), influencing their likelihood of believing and spreading rumors. The project aims to investigate how changing parameters such as population density (P), transmission delay (L), and the distribution of skepticism levels impact the rate of rumor spread in the network.
